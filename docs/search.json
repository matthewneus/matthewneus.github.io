I grouped the data by each team, found the mean of each team’s total offensive plays ran, and then filtered the data to just include Big Ten teams.\nFrom there, I arranged the data to see the team that averaged the most offensive plays, sorted the data to just show that average and the team, and used “distinct()” to get rid of any duplicate data.\n\n\nCode\ncfb23 &lt;- cfb23 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    avg_off_plays = mean(OffensivePlays)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == 'Big Ten Conference')\n\nbigten23 &lt;- cfb23 |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_off_plays)) |&gt;\n  select(Team, avg_off_plays) |&gt;\n  distinct()\n\n\nI followed the same steps steps I did for the 2023 data for the 2024 data, even though the season is still happening.\n\n\nCode\ncfb24 &lt;- cfb24 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    avg_off_plays = mean(OffensivePlays)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == 'Big Ten Conference')\n\nbigten24 &lt;- cfb24 |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_off_plays)) |&gt;\n  select(Team, avg_off_plays) |&gt;\n  distinct()\n\n\nHere is a bar chart that shows the average of offensive plays each team ran in 2023. I used the team name as my x-axis and the average number of offensive plays for my y-axis. I weighted the bar chart by the average offensive plays and arranged it to show a rise from the team with the lowest average of offensive plays to the most.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=bigten23, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Team, avg_off_plays), \n      weight=avg_off_plays\n      )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI followed the same steps I did for the 2023 data for the 2024 data, even though the season is still happening.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=bigten24, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Team, avg_off_plays), \n      weight=avg_off_plays\n      )\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– Maryland’s offense is on the field for more plays than any other Big Ten team so far in 2024. The Terps averaged around 72 offensive plays per game through five games, up from their average of 66 offensive plays throughout the entire 2023 season. Maryland’s has played an FCS school and a non-power five school during its first five games of 2024, which may be aiding the increase of offensive possessions.\nPurdue’s offense has underwent one of the worst xx in the Big Ten so far in 2024. The Boilermakers ranked second in 2023 for average offensive plays, but rank last so far in 2024 through five games."
